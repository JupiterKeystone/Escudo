## Scheduled software upgrades

Escudo uses a fixed-schedule software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that users of Escudo (end users and service providers) should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular schedule. Software upgrades occur during the months of April and October. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check the repository prior to this date for the proper Monero software version. Below is the historical schedule and the projected schedule for the next upgrade.
Dates are provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

| Software upgrade block height  | Date       | Fork version      | Minimum Escudo version | Recommended Escudo version | Details                                                                            |  
| ------------------------------ | -----------| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                |            |                   |                        |                            |                                                                                    |



## Release staging schedule and protocol
Approximately three months prior to a scheduled software upgrade, a branch from master will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should then be made to both master and the new release branch. Pull requests that require extensive review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should not be made to the release branch.
